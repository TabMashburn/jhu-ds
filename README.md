## Task

The goal of your project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the `classe` variable in the
training set. You may use any of the other variables to predict with. You should create a report describing 
- how you built your model 
- how you used cross validation
- what you think the expected out of sample error is
- why you made the choices you did

You will also use your prediction model to predict 20 different test cases.

Your submission for the Peer Review portion should consist of a link to a Github repo with your R markdown and
compiled HTML file describing your analysis. Please constrain the text of the writeup to < 2000 words and the number
of figures to be less than 5. It will make it easier for the graders if you submit a repo with a gh-pages branch
so the HTML page can be viewed online (and you always want to make it easy on graders :-).
